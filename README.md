# Finally Quiet

This software was created as a demo for Finally Quiet to demonstrate their all in one dashboard for dental offices.

## Technologies used

Many different technologies were used to create this software, with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) being the foundation.

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) 
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [Planetscale (MySQL)](https://planetscale.com/)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)


## Features

There are many features that are needed to manage not only your own office, but every office in the Finally Quiet Ecosystem.

- Role management (Demo only)
- Log in with Google for added ease (Demo only)
- Role based page permissions and authentication
- Create dental office and add your staff
- Interacting with other users in the Finally Quiet Ecosystem
- Managing patients and members of your office
- Log of every action to comply with HIPAA

## Difference between demo and production

The demo version of this software had the task of creating a foundation from complete scratch with a focus on testing. As a result of being completely from scratch, some things from the demo will be built on or changed.

- Dedicated servers and hosting
- Sign in with Finally Quiet credentials, not just Google
- Disallow role switching
- Remove the ability to clear the action log 
- Fetching data from Finally Quiet hardware
- Privatized patient information page


## What comes next?

As Finally Quiet's hardware and vision develops, there will be added ideas and constraints that will be added or removed from this demo. More members of the team and community will share their thoughts and we will take those into consideration. This is just the beginning of Finally Quiet's software.
